# The Snake Game - Python

## What is the Snake game?
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line (a body) which grows in length when eating food on the ground, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.

## Description
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake has a specific length depending on how much food it collects where one eaten piece of food prolongs the body for one unit, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.

The snake movement cannot be stopped - it is always moving but the direction can be controlled by arrow keys.
The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible without touching anything except the food itself.
